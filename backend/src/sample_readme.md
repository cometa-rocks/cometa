To use variables in steps, use the syntax `${variableName}`.

### Data-Driven Testing

Co.meta supports data-driven testing, allowing you to execute the same test with multiple data sets:

1. Prepare a CSV file with your test data (each column represents a variable, each row a test iteration)
2. In the test configuration, navigate to the "Data-Driven" tab
3. Enable data-driven testing by toggling the switch
4. Upload or select your data source
5. Map columns to test variables
6. Configure execution options (run all iterations, stop on first failure, etc.)
7. Save the configuration

During execution, the test will run once for each row in your data source, replacing variables with the corresponding values from each row.

- **Environment Definitions**: Create and manage test environments
- **Variables**: Set environment-specific variables
- **Connectivity**: Configure proxy settings and security
- **Integrations**: Set up connections to external systems

To configure environments:

1. Navigate to the "Admin" section
2. Select "Environments"
3. Click "Add Environment" or select an existing one
4. Configure environment settings
5. Save the configuration

### Browser Configurations

Co.meta supports extensive browser configuration:

- **Browser Versions**: Specify which browser versions to use
- **Extensions**: Add browser extensions for testing
- **Profiles**: Create custom browser profiles with specific settings
- **Mobile Emulation**: Configure mobile device settings
- **Proxy Settings**: Configure network proxies for different browsers

To manage browser configurations:

1. Navigate to the "Admin" section
2. Select "Browsers"
3. Configure browser settings
4. Set default browsers for testing
5. Save the configuration

## Best Practices

### Organizing Tests

- **Folder Structure**: Create a logical hierarchy for your tests based on functionality, modules, or user flows
- **Naming Conventions**: Use clear, descriptive names for tests and steps (e.g., "Login_ValidCredentials" instead of "Test1")
- **Test Independence**: Each test should be self-contained and not depend on other tests
- **Reusability**: Share common steps across tests where possible using reusable components
- **Tagging**: Use tags to categorize tests for easy filtering and organization

### Creating Reliable Tests

- **Robust Selectors**: Use stable selectors that won't break with UI changes (prefer IDs and data attributes over CSS classes)
- **Appropriate Waits**: Use explicit waits instead of fixed delays to handle timing issues
- **Error Handling**: Include recovery steps for known issues or intermittent failures
- **Assertions**: Verify conditions rather than assuming success after actions
- **Isolation**: Tests should clean up after themselves and not leave data that affects other tests

### Maintenance Strategies

- **Regular Review**: Periodically review and update tests to match application changes
- **Modular Design**: Create reusable components for common functionality to minimize update effort
- **Documentation**: Document assumptions, special handling, and known limitations
- **Version Control**: Track changes to tests alongside application code
- **Parameterization**: Use variables and parameters to make tests more adaptable to changes

### Performance Considerations

- **Test Size**: Keep tests focused on specific functionality instead of creating lengthy end-to-end tests
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor browser memory and CPU usage during test execution
- **Parallel Execution**: Configure tests to run concurrently when possible
- **Scheduling**: Distribute test execution to minimize resource contention
- **Cleanup**: Remove temporary files, screenshots, and logs that are no longer needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Element Not Found
- **Symptom**: Step fails with "Element not found" error
- **Solutions**:
  - Check if the selector is correct using browser dev tools
  - Add appropriate wait steps before interaction
  - Verify the element exists in the application at the expected time
  - Check if the element is inside an iframe
  - Use more robust selectors (IDs instead of classes)

#### Test Timing Issues
- **Symptom**: Test passes sometimes and fails others
- **Solutions**:
  - Add explicit waits for dynamic elements
  - Increase timeout settings for slower environments
  - Wait for specific conditions instead of fixed times
  - Check for race conditions between test steps and application state

#### Visual Validation Failures
- **Symptom**: Visual validation fails despite no visible issues
- **Solutions**:
  - Adjust comparison threshold to allow for minor rendering differences
  - Update baseline images when UI intentionally changes
  - Check for dynamic content (dates, random images) and exclude from comparison
  - Exclude volatile areas from comparison using exclusion zones

#### Browser Compatibility
- **Symptom**: Test works in one browser but fails in another
- **Solutions**:
  - Use browser-specific selectors where needed
  - Add browser detection and conditional logic
  - Check for browser-specific features or limitations
  - Test with the same browser versions in all environments
